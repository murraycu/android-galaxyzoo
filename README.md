=================

Update (2021): The zooniverse team changed their server API a couple of years ago, and I never found time to update the app to make it work again. Pull requests are always welcome.

This Android app lets you classify Galaxy Zoo subjects.
It is official and approved by the Zooniverse project.

Feedback and source code pull requests (or patches) are very welcome.
